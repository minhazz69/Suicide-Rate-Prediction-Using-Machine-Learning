# Suicide-Rate-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
a Jupyter notebook using python to predict suicide rate

Suicide rate prediction system using various parameters that can predict the suicide number corresponding the population of a country. The dataset used for this problem is collected from Kaggel. The dataset is provided here.

For explanatory data analysis following graphs are used-
1. Histogram
2. Scatter Plot
3. Box Plot
4. Countplot

For eleminating important categorical value problem 'One hot Encoding' has been applied.

2 different type of Machine Learning algorithm has been integrated to predict the suicide rate. Such as-
1. Random Forest
2. Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
